/**
 * Storefront brand lockup — the linked logo + wordmark that sits at
 * the top-left of every shell (desktop header, mobile header, footer).
 *
 * Rules:
 *   1. If the admin has uploaded a brand logo for the surface tone
 *      (light / dark), render it as the badge. Width is bounded so a
 *      tall/wide source still fits the chrome — `object-contain`
 *      preserves aspect ratio inside that box.
 *   2. If no logo is uploaded, render the wordmark only — no
 *      `ShoppingBag` placeholder badge. This is the explicit
 *      "text-only fallback" contract the admin sees on the Settings
 *      page.
 *   3. `siteName` is always shown next to the badge. Brands often want
 *      the wordmark visible even when there *is* an icon (recall
 *      ratio); designers can simply not upload a logo to lose the
 *      badge.
 *
 * Consumers select the tone from the surface behind the lockup. The
 * wrapper colours the wordmark so call sites do not repeat that token.
